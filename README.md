# project1 - exploratory analysis and presentation

# Proposal: I plan to analyze the relationship between interest rates in the US (based on the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) effective Fed Funds rate) and the forward-looking valuations of large US businesses (based on S&P500 index price-to-earnings (PE) ratios).
### Originally considered looking at tech company valuations specifically, via NASDAQ index PE ratios and because interest rates anecdotally seem to have a greater impact on tech company valuations due to longer average time-to-value industry-wide. Went with broader S&P 500 index data because it's available across a much longer time period, and Fed interest rates move quite slowly over years and differently over decades.

# pulling starting points for dependencies and data loading from WeatherPy activity (week/module06)

# found datasets via Kaggle (interest rates by month) and NASDAQ Data Link API (S&P 500 PE ratios by month)
