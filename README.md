# Proposal: I would like to analyze the relationship between interest rates (represented by US Fed Funds Rate if available) and technology company valuations (represented by NASDAQ index overall value). I am aware of the NASDAQ API from our class, but looking for the right dataset for the fed funds rate.. treasury.gov seems to offer plenty of datasets but I haven't located what I'm looking for yet.
